# Call for application for Machine Learning Camp Jeju 2017

If you have studied machine learning/deep learning and TensorFlow, you probably want to implement a non-trivial and large-scale system for real use. We invite you to the month-long Machine Learning Camp Jeju 2017, where you can make that dream a reality.
 
For a full month in beautiful Jeju Island, you and other participants will train a deep learning model using TensorFlow from start-to-finish. Jeff Dean (Google Senior Fellow via Hangout), Rajat Monga (Google/TensorFlow Director (TBC)), and Prof. 
KyungHyun Cho	(NYU, (TBC)) will give us keynote talks. Plus, you will have access to experienced mentors including Namju Kim (Head of Research for Kakao Brain), Sung Kim (HKUST), Lucy Park (TF-KR), Donghyun Kwak (TF-KR), Terry Taewoong Um (TF-KR), and many more. We hope you take advantage of this wonderful opportunity.
 
Those selected as participants will be provided with one round-trip airfare (up to 300 USD) to Jeju Island (South Korea), room and board at Jeju National University, USD 1,000 in stipends (can be used for the airfare, etc.) and USD 500 to 1,000 in Google Cloud Credit. In addition to these benefits, participants will gain valuable and practical experience in the field of deep learning. We look forward to your application!
 
*Mentor Recruitment: If you’re interested in sharing your experiences and expertise with the camp, please contact us at mljejucamp@googlegroups.com. You will serve as personal mentors to 1 to 2 participants, holding 2 to 3 on/offline meetings a week to help them successfully complete their projects. While it is possible for you to provide online-only mentoring, we suggest you visit Jeju Island to meet with your mentees in person. We will provide round-trip airfare (up to USD 300) to Jeju Island and up to five (5) days of room and board.*
 
(Information regarding schedule, program and benefits are subject to change as we are in the process of finalizing the details. We will have more information later.)

## About Jeju
Located just off the coast of the Korean peninsula, Jeju Island is the largest volcanic island in Korea. Also known as Asia's Hawaii, the island is rife with beautiful sceneries and getaway resorts. Jeju boasts several natural treasures including Mount Halla, the country's highest peak, Trail Olle that winds around the rocky coastline, and Sunrise Peak, a dormant volcano ideal for catching sunrises and sunsets. You will be able to fully experience the island's charm for as long as a month without a visa. For more information, please visit at: http://www.visitjeju.net/en/index.jto. 

## About Camp
Deep Learning Camp Jeju 2017 is a month-long program (July 3-28, 2017) where participants gain hands-on experience with TensorFlow through individual-based projects with the goal of implementing new deep learning related ideas, and/or already-published ideas. We are looking for approximately 20 participants. More than a dozen industry experts with strong backgrounds in deep learning and TensorFlow implementation will serve as project mentors to guide participants. 

## FAQs

#### Q: What are we doing during the one month program?
A: Basically, we design a deep learning model and fully implement using TensorFlow. It is also possible to (re) implement a published paper (by others) and adapt it for new datasets. Based on this, each participants will propose their own plans in their application.


#### Q: What type of Visa is required for foreigners?
A: No visa is required for most countries. Please check at  http://www.immigration.go.kr/HP/IMM80/imm_04/imm_p01/vm3.jsp 

#### Q. Can I apply for partial participation? (i.e. only weekends)
A: Unfortunately No.

#### Q: Is this only for students?
A: No. Anyone who can spend one full month in Jeju Island in Korea, and work from 10AM-5PM during the weekdays can apply.

#### Q: Is this a contest?
A: No, this is not a contest. Individuals will have different projects.

#### Q: Is this a training or teaching program?
A: This is not specifically a teaching event. The applicant should have good understandings on programming, machine learning/deep learning, and TensorFlow. However, we will provide mentors to assist you on your project.

#### Q: Will data for training be provided or it is up to participants?
A: We will provide some public data sets but participants can also utilize their own data.

#### Q: Should I bring my laptop?
A: We won’t provide PCs. You need to bring your laptop. However, we will provide cloud server credits.

#### Q: Training takes a lot of time and computing power. Does the camp provide any support?
A: We will provide cloud server credits.

#### Q: What are the criteria for selecting applicants?
A: There is no formal criteria, but we are looking for interesting and feasible projects.

#### Q: What if the attendee cannot complete the work that they submitted?
A: There is no penalty, but mentors will guide each participant to success.

#### Q: Can developers/researchers working on longer term projects like http://ai-on.org/projects/cardiac-mri-segmentation.html apply? In this case, one month may not be sufficient time to finish the work. Is it OK to apply?
A: It’s OK. As long as the project is interesting, we will consider it. You can also propose a small portion of a larger project that you wish to work on for a month.

#### Q: Is this only for deep learning? Can I propose a reinforcement learning project?
A: Yes, reinforcement learning is acceptable. Feel free to include other types of interesting machine learning projects.

#### Q: Can I participate in a keynote session or open seminars even though I am not a camp participant?
A: Yes, the keynote and open seminars are open to everyone. We will have a separate announcement regarding keynote sessions  and open seminars.

#### Q: Will you also be recruiting staff members for the camp?
A: Sorry, but we have no current plans to recruit staff members.

#### Q: I do have more questions. Where should I contact?
A: Please use the issue (https://github.com/TensorFlowKR/MLJejuCamp/issues) of this page to ask questions.
